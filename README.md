# Python Algorithmic Exercises 

This repository contains Python scripts developed during my Computer Science studies at Hellenic Open University (HOU).

## Contents

### 1. Number Triangle Generator (`number_triangle.py`)
A command-line tool that generates numeric patterns based on user input.
* **Concepts:** Nested Loops, Input Validation.

### 2. Collatz Conjecture Analysis (`collatz_sequence.py`)
An implementation of the famous **3n + 1 problem**. 
* **Features:**
    * Calculates the sequence for user input.
    * Analyzes the range [2, 10000] to find the number with the longest chain efficiently.
* **Concepts:** Loops, Conditionals, Algorithmic Logic.

### 3. Geometry Inspector (`triangle_inspector.py`)
A mathematical tool that analyzes geometric properties based on coordinates.
* **Features:**
    * Validates if points form a real triangle.
    * Calculates Area (Heron's Formula) and Perimeter.
    * Classifies triangle by sides (Equilateral/Scalene) and angles (Acute/Right).
* **Concepts:** `math` module, functions, complex logic checks.

### 4. Library Management System (`library_manager.py`)
A comprehensive system simulating a library database using **Dictionaries** and **Lists**.
* **Features:**
    * View book catalog & availability status.
    * Borrow/Return functionality with input validation.
    * Rating system that calculates average scores dynamically.
* **Concepts:** Data Structures (Dict/List), CRUD operations, Error Handling.

## How to run
Make sure you have Python installed. You can run any of the scripts like this:

```bash
# Run the Number Triangle generator
python number_triangle.py

# Run the Collatz sequence analyzer
python collatz_sequence.py

# Run the Geometry Tool
python triangle_inspector.py

# Run the Library System
python library_manager.py
```
