# Python Algorithmic Exercises 

This repository contains Python scripts developed during my Computer Science studies at Hellenic Open University (HOU).

## Contents

### 1. Number Triangle Generator (`number_triangle.py`)
A command-line tool that generates numeric patterns based on user input.
* **Concepts:** Nested Loops, Input Validation.

### 2. Collatz Conjecture Analysis (`collatz_sequence.py`)
An implementation of the famous **3n + 1 problem**. 
* **Features:**
    * Calculates the sequence for user input.
    * Analyzes the range [2, 10000] to find the number with the longest chain efficiently.
* **Concepts:** Loops, Conditionals, Algorithmic Logic.

## How to run
Make sure you have Python installed. You can run any of the scripts like this:

```bash
# Run the Number Triangle generator
python number_triangle.py

# Run the Collatz sequence analyzer
python collatz_sequence.py
```
